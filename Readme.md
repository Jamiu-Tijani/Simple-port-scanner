# Simple Port Scanner

## Description
This Enhanced Port Scanner is a powerful and versatile tool designed for security engineers and network administrators. It allows for comprehensive scanning of networked systems to identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities. This tool now includes features like parameterized scanning, multi-threading for faster execution, and advanced scanning techniques.

## Features
- **Parameterized Scanning**: Specify target IP, port ranges, and verbosity via command-line arguments.
- **Multi-Threading**: Significantly increases the scanning speed by utilizing multiple threads for simultaneous scanning.
- **Advanced Scanning Techniques**:
  - SYN Scans for stealthier and more efficient scanning.
  - UDP Scans to identify open UDP ports.
  - FIN Scans to probe ports without establishing a full TCP connection.
- **Verbose Output**: Detailed information about open ports and ongoing scanning processes.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on various operating systems with Python support.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Scapy (for advanced scanning techniques)


## Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational and legitimate security analysis purposes only. Users must ensure they have proper authorization before scanning any network or system. Unauthorized scanning and network probing may be illegal and unethical in many countries and contexts.
